UrbanFlow is a platform that allows scientists to synthesize massive Geolocated Twitter data with detailed land use maps. This platform would allow scientists to gather observations to better understand human mobility patterns in relation to urban land use, study citiesâ€™ spatial networks based on identifying common frequent visitors between different urban neighborhoods and monitoring the patterns of urban land use change.
